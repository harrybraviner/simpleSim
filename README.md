=========

# Current Objectives

* Get a test working with an object travelling in a straight line with no force acting on it.
* Same but with a constant force.
* As above, but with the object rotating too.
* Object travelling in a straight line

# Design requirements

* Vehicles (bodies) should not be responsible for updating their own positions.
  This should be the responsibility of the simulation they're attached to.
